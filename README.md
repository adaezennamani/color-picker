A simple Color picker game where the user guesses random numbers from 1-3 and randomly selects a color box,this color box returns an error message if the user's guess is wrong and a congratulatory message if the user is right. 
it was designed using CSS and structured using basic JavaScript.
I made use of if statements, math.random, math.floor and so on.
have a good game play!âœ…
